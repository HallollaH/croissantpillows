                    <p class="text-white-50">One day, Waffle McIron was sitting on his couch and had a strange craving for a croissant, but he had one problem, he didn't want to get up. Later, he made the world's largest croissant and used it as a pillow. The pillow uses state of the art dough technology that allows it to change its squishiness according to the user. Our first-generation croissant pillow used boring old dough, but our new version uses our B.U.T.T.E.R technology. This stands for Better User Trained Truffle Eating Race. The technology allows us to give people pillows who eat the most truffles in the shortest amount of time. Why this competition you may ask because the people who eat the most truffles are most likely to lie down for longer and end up eating their pillow and order another one. Our patented technology allows for optimal user experience by mitigating hunger and preventing people from leaving the comfort of their couch. People will ask why this product matters. The simple answer is that a study conducted last year shows that 100% of people who have couches have been too lazy to get up from said couch while wanting food. Our goal is to cater to those people who can't provide for themselves, and need a tasty croissant to eat when they are lying down in bed, on their favorite chair, on their couch, or just extremely lazy. According to the Center for Disease Control, croissant pillows are not an illness, and in fact, the next step in humans evolving into the people from WALL-E. According to 100% of lazy people, they'll do whatever they have to do in about 5 minutes, and 5 hours later it still hasn't been done. Waffle McIron faced this issue many times until he created the croissant pillow. Now whenever someone asks him to do something, he just offers them a croissant and they can't talk anymore because they're eating a croissant. Croissants can be used as a hammer if you leave it out for long enough. Or, in Waffle McIron's case, you can build your entire house out of them. If you're attending a fancy event, and need a stylish hat, eat a bit of the pillow and then use it as a hat! Studies show that 100% of people who like croissants like the hat when offered a hat. Need a suitcase for a trip? Take a couple of bites and you've got a bag. As you may know, some people say that croissant pillows don't taste like croissants. This is completely a lie, they have just never had a croissant. Croissant Pillows was featured on CrunchyTechYum's top ten products that shouldn't exist, where it was said that even though it shouldn't exist, it gets used every day in their office. Our customers describe the pillow as DÃ©licieux, C R O M C H Y, and even WHEAT. It's astonishing what people can do with just their croissant pillow.
